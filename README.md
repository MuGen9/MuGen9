I am a highly motivated Product Manager in the process of changing career path to become a full-time Software Developer.  
Currently I'm focused on front-end programming, mainly JavaScript and React.  
I graduated a JavaScript Developer course in Coders Lab school. 
I have entry-level experience in commercial front-end projects. 

I'm looking to collaborate on front-end projects and contribute to open source projects!
